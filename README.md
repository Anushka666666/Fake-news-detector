# Fake-news-detector
A Machine Learning + NLP project that classifies news articles as FAKE or REAL and explains predictions using SHAP. The app is built with Streamlit for a simple interactive demo, accepts raw text or a URL, and shows the top words that pushed the decision.

Features:
- Paste text or enter a URL of a news article.
- Predicts whether the article is REAL or FAKE.
- Shows important words influencing prediction using SHAP.
- Simple and interactive "Streamlit web app".

 üóÇÔ∏è Dataset:
We used the Kaggle Fake News Dataset, which contains:
- True.csv: Verified real news articles
- Fake.csv: Fake/misleading news articles

Each file has:
- title: headline of the news
- text: full article body
- subject: category/topic of news
- date: publishing date

For this project, we mainly used the "text" field.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack:
- Python
- pandas, scikit-learn, nltk : Data cleaning & ML model
- TF-IDF + Logistic Regression: Fake news classification
- SHAP: Explainability 
- BeautifulSoup4 + requests: Extract news content from URLs
